<p align="justify">Hey there! My name is <b>Izge Bayyurt</b>, I am from Istanbul, Turkey, and currently residing in San Francisco, CA. I graduated from Colby College in May 2022 with a degree in Computer Science and I am looking for software engineering opportunities.</p>

<p align="justify">In Colby's Computer Science department, students pursue a project-oriented curriculum, driving them to go beyond of the scope of in class material. In my first semester, I wrote a modified clone of the classic game 'Astroids' in Python as my final project. This experience led me to pursue a career in video game design. I also had a chance to participate in Bowdoin College's hackathon held in February 2019, where my friend Tyler Hanson and I won the 2nd place prize with our arcade game 'Marblz', written from scratch in 8 hours.</p>

<p align="justify">I worked as a research assistant as part of the the Molecular Spectroscopy Research Group <a href='http://fen.istanbul.edu.tr/fizik/?p=6536'> at Istanbul University Department of Physics</a>, where I assisted with the chemical analysis of material. I am also a member of <a href='http://fen.istanbul.edu.tr/fizik/?p=6536'>Youth Science Program at Istanbul University</a>, through which I have attended undergraduate classes in classical mechanics and molecular biology and genetics, and <a href="http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/diger/184478/iU_nun_dahileri_Cern_e_gidecek.html">visited the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).</a></p>

<p align="justify">I am a licensed chess player in <a href="http://www.tsf.org.tr/">Turkish Chess Federation (TSF)</a>, with an <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/card.phtml?event=6323154">ELO of 1844</a>, participated and placed highly on national and international tournaments, and covered in national and international media. I am also a certified chess coach and had voluntary experience of preparing young players between the age of 7-11 for an upcoming national tournament. I continue to play chess regularly, and find the intersection of chess and analytic mathematics and combinatorics especially intriguing.</p>
